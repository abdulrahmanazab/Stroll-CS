Submission of external jobs to sensitive data e-infrastructures introduces additional complexity due to the additional security barriers involved. \name is a universal \fs-based interface for seamless task submission to HPC platforms. Deploying \name client-server for job submission to the sensitive data HPC cluster substantially reduces the complexity of job submission and result collection, without introducing considerable performance overhead. \name is part of is an ongoing effort for building a Nordic federated sensitive data cloud. the future work directions involve:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Evaluation of the \name overhead in the overall job life time
	\item Support \name client-server for production in TSD
	\item Evaluate the production use of \name as a front-end in sensitive data cloud federation 
\end{itemize}
